# Assembly_Instruction_Decoder

## Overview: üó£Ô∏è  
This project is a tool that takes in a list of MIPS assembly instructions and analyzes their usage patterns. It
reads the input, decodes each instruction, and then returns statistics on how often each type of instruction appears.
The goal is to give a basic breakdown of the instruction mix, which can be useful for understanding program behavior or
optimizing performance. In a broad sense, this project resembles part of what happens deep inside a computer
when it processes low-level instructions though it in a much more abstract and simplified way.
